# Machine_Learning_Audience_Generator
## Description
Audience_Generator is a web application designed to create targeted audience profiles based on user-entered keywords. The application retrieves data from social media platforms using ethical practices and APIs, analyzes the sentiment using a RoBERTa-based transformer model, and selects users with positive sentiments to form a curated audience. This tool is ideal for marketers, researchers, and social media managers looking to engage with a positively inclined audience.

## Features
- Data Collection: Live data is collected from the APIs of social media websites such as Reddit, Youtube and Twitter/X
- Keyword Selection: To broaden the scope of data extraction and enhance the dataset's quality, a similar word generation based on cosine similarityby harnessing a pre-trained word2Vec model is implemented.

- Data Preprocessing: Since social media data can be dirty, I have employed various preprocessing techniques such as removing handlers, hashtags, URLs, non-alphanumeric characters, and non-English words. Additionally, I have utilized tokenization and stemming.
- Data Processing: This cleaned data is then sent to a roberta based transformer model which was trained on 124M tweets for sentiment analysis. This model performed better than other models (TextBlob, Vader, Flair).

- Data Storage: Details of users from the positive sentiment analysis is stored which can be used as data for interested users in targeted marketing. For this case I used a Postgresql table to store this data
